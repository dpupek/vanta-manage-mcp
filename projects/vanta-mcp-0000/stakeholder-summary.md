# Stakeholder Summary

## Admins / Compliance Owners
This server provides one MCP endpoint to read and manage the full Vanta API surface. Safe-mode defaults prevent accidental writes by requiring explicit confirmation for mutations.

## Security and Risk Teams
Workflow tools reduce manual API sequences for failing control triage, vendor review actions, and vulnerability remediation workflows while preserving auditability in tool outputs.

## Audit / GRC Stakeholders
Audit-scoped tools and workflows support information request handling and evidence lifecycle operations with deterministic plan-first behavior.

## Integration Engineers
Connector operations are exposed with parity tooling and `connector_` naming, enabling predictable synchronization workflows from MCP clients.
